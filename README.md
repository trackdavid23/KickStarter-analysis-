## Understanding of Surrounding Fundraising Data

### The process
   We have been brought on by Louise, who had previous lost her fundraiser due to time constraint was not able to raise money for her play.She is now 
requesting that we collect data for the whole year to see how other campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.
We are to calucate the time and what the amount are of each campaign.First visualing their outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Analysis and Challenges
   Starting off we collect and sort the number of campaigns into three categories , cancelled, failed and successful, by creating a pivot table to show the data.Fixing the data into proper standard date and time to see the start and finish of each campaigns, applying filter to compare to Lousie campaign of theater is see the amount of successful completion.From the data collected and organized we were able to visulaize the relationship between outcome and launch month.Thus showing what size campaigns and the amount of success they recived in beng fund, underfunded or even overfunded.Seeing the percentage of success change for each outcome. Had diffculit connecting to function of countifs to number of successfull $1,000 fundraisers not knowing using the less than number doesnt just count for the use of the contindional statement of successful, failed and cancelled.Using the Carrot and stck graph to see the difference. The box whisper chart showâ€™s us the differences particularly in regards of how the graph was spread out in price or towards category. Another problem that occurred was that we only calculated the category of theater . The best option would be to calculate the total of fundraising going on in the year.

### Results
Another analysis that we can derive from  the fundraising data is that we could see the correlation between a fundraising being canceled and how long it took to  get to that point; allows us and o figure out the causality of a project succeeding or being an failed.  The best  time to plan and excute the most time effect fundrasiing is between the months of may, june and july between the price range of Theather verus the use of the other category from the data provided from Louise.From limitation that occures from the dataset provide by Lousie.One big companstration is by tallying the different in Campaign caterogory such as drama versus plays or versus musicals.Another way to see the difference in campaigns is by creating a pie grapgh showing the difffernce each category of fundrassing to show which hold the bigggest distrubation of the monetary success.
